    <h1>Welcome to GMXMDS Setup and Run Platform</h1>
    <p>The Platform provides you with automated approaches to: </p>
	<p>		1. Prepare receptor ligand complexes and generate required topology files for Molecular Dynamics Simulations</p>
 	<p>		2. Prepare Peptides and Proteins and generate required topology files for Molecular Dynamics Simulations</p>
    <p>		3. Perform a test run or full scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations using generated solvated structures and topology files in Gromacs</p>
	<p>Please Note that while the generated structures and topology files may be useful in other systems, they are here generated to be compatible with Gromacs</h3>
	<p>Please click the "QGuides" tab to get a Quick Guide on using the platform</h3>
