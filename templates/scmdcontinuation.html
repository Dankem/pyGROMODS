  <h1>Continuation of MD Simulation</h1>
    
	<div>
		<p>By clicking the MDScon button below, you will be required to select appropriate folder containing previous work. This folder is usually in the form "mdsgmx_*" inside "MDSHOME" folder, where "*" is the previous autogenerated unique identifier for each MDS run. This folder will be checked and the point of continuation will be determined based on already generated subfolder(s) and files from the previous run. The following are possible: </p>

			<p>1). Assuming no interruption in previous stage, Continuation begins with the next autodetected stage.</p>
			<p>2). Assuming interruption in a stage, Continuation can begin from point of interruption</p>
			<p>3). Assuming extension of timesteps of a stage, Continuation can begin from the last point</p>
			<p>4). Though, no interruption, if you have a preferred point of continuation, simply delete/backup the corresponding subfolder within your proposed working directory</p>

			<p> <strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT: </strong> </p>
				<p>A). Options 2 and 3 are only currently implemented for Equilibration (EMD) and Production (PMD) MDS</p>
				<p>B). To use option 3, follow gromacs manual to extend your tpr file and name the new file extend.tpr</p>

		<p><strong> You will be asked to confirm your choice </strong></p>

		<p><strong> Now if you are set to go, click MDScon below</strong></p>
